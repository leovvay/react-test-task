# React Test Task

Test task built using React/Redux which shows basic GitHub user info.

Demo: https://steelrat.gitlab.io/react-test-task.

## Usage

- install locally: clone and run `npm run tests`
- run tests: `npm run tests`
- run dev server: `npm run start`

## TODO

- code style/analyze linter
- more unit tests to cover other cases
- e2e tests (at least one ðŸ˜Š)
- more decomposition: make common UI parts to be components (like `dt`+`dd` or a whole `dl`)
